# Meals Scheduler Application Mockup

## What this mockup is and is not?

This mockup is a way for us to explore how we can use the datasets we have to implement a meal scheduler/builder application which focuses on the user's goal weight, activity, budget and lifestyle. We are importing some acquired datasets into the notebook to prepare them for being used to collect useful data as to achieve the main goal (generate a logically correct diet). It's not a final version of the data nor the algorithms. Everything will be optimized on the way to the goal.

## Competition

The project has been made before but with less features than we plan to implement and this is where our USP comes into place.

## What to expect

This is an iteration of how we are planning to implement the actual product, so, some data processing should be expected.

## Installation

You can find the installation documentation for the
[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
The documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found

For a local installation, make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:

    $ pip install notebook
